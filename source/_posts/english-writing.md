## Movies: series or entertaining?

The world's  movie industry has witnessed unprecedented boom in recent years. Delighted with an ample supply of excellent motion pictures, global audiences are thankful for the combined efforts made by film crews. Among these popular productions, serious movies and entertaining movies are the most influential. Some viewers are in favor of the former, saying serious ones evoke deeper thoughts, while other fans support the latter due to their humor. According to my preference, I would express my appreciation for serious movies.

To begin with, one of the most essential goals in movie making is to enrich people's inner world. To some extent, serious movies are playing the role of pilots that can guide people psychologically. Books can provide humans with food for thought and so can serious movies. An outstanding serious movie encourages the audience to make full use of their imaginations and common sense to think logically. Normally, mysteries are hidden in these movies so as to arouse people's curiosity. With a burning desire to find the answer, the viewers try hard to find the answer before the movie concludes. One example is a classic movie entitled *Murder on the Orient Express*. The plot is so thought provoking that viewers are turned into detectives themselves. In the movie, a murder is committed on the train and a number of passengers are brought under suspicion. Motivated to discover the real murderer, viewers are willing to make their own judgment. Needless to say, watching such a movie is just like going on an unforgettable inner journey.
